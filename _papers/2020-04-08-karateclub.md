title: "An API Oriented Open-source Python Framework for Unsupervised Learning on Graphs"
collection: papers
permalink: /papers/2020-04-08-karateclub
excerpt: 'We present Karate Club a Python framework combining more than 30 state-of-the-art graph mining algorithms which can solve unsupervised machine learning tasks. The primary goal of the package is to make community detection, node and whole graph embedding available to a wide audience of machine learning researchers and practitioners. We designed Karate Club with an emphasis on a consistent application interface, scalability, ease of use, sensible out of the box model behaviour, standardized dataset ingestion, and output generation. This paper discusses the design principles behind this framework with practical examples. We show Karate Club's efficiency with respect to learning performance on a wide range of real world clustering problems, classification tasks and support evidence with regards to its competitive speed.'

Karate Club consists of state-of-the-art methods to do unsupervised learning on graph structured data. To put it simply it is a Swiss Army knife for small-scale graph mining research. First, it provides network embedding techniques at the node and graph level. Second, it includes a variety of overlapping and non-overlapping community detection methods. Implemented methods cover a wide range of network science (NetSci, Complenet), data mining (ICDM, CIKM, KDD), artificial intelligence (AAAI, IJCAI) and machine learning (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR) conferences, workshops, and pieces from prominent journals.
