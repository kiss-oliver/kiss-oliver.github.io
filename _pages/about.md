I am an Economics PhD Candidate at the Department of Economics and Business at Central European University. I'm supervised by [Adam Szeidl](http://www.personal.ceu.hu/staff/Adam_Szeidl/). My main interest is empirical political economy. I especially enjoy constructing efficient data pipelines to understand patterns in otherwise difficult-to-handle, large data sets. 

I received my MA in Economics at CEU and my BA in Applied Economics at Corvinus University of Budapest. I also have a pre-degree certificate from the Business and Management BA program of Corvinus University of Budapest.

I am also a research assistant at the [CEU Microdata Research Group](http://microdata.io) since 2017 where I mostly work on data engineering tasks.
