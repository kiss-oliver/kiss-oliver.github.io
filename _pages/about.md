I am an Economics PhD Candidate at the Department of Economics and Business at Central European University. I'm supervised by [Adam Szeidl](http://www.personal.ceu.hu/staff/Adam_Szeidl/). My main interest is empirical political economy. I especially enjoy constructing efficient data pipelines to understand patterns in otherwise difficult-to-handle, large data sets. 

I received my MA in Economics at CEU and my BA in Applied Economics at Corvinus University of Budapest. I also have a pre-degree certificate from the Business and Management BA program of Corvinus University of Budapest.

I am also a research assistant at the [CEU Microdata Research Group](http://microdata.io) since 2017 where I mostly work on data engineering tasks.

Projects
======
Pytorch Geometric Temporal
-----
We are working on publicly releasing PyTorch Geometric Temporal the first deep learning library for parametric spatiotemporal machine learning models. We provide data loaders and iterators with PyTorch Geometric Temporal}which can handle constant and varying time difference spatiotemporal datasets. We release novel challenging spatiotemporal benchmark datasets from the renewable energy production, epidemiological reporting, goods delivery and web traffic forecasting domains. We evaluate the spatiotemporal signal processing and forecasting capabilities of the neural and parametric machine learning models available in PyTorch Geometric Temporal on real world datasets. 

The GitHub repository of the project is available [here](https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki/pytorch_geometric_temporal).

Chickenpox cases - Hungary
-----
Recurrent graph convolutional neural networks are highly effective machine learning techniques for spatiotemporal signal processing. Newly proposed graph neural network architectures are repetitively evaluated on standard tasks such as traffic or weather forecasting. In this paper, we propose the Chickenpox Cases in Hungary dataset as a new dataset for comparing graph neural network architectures. Our time series analysis and forecasting experiments demonstrate that the Chickenpox Cases in Hungary dataset is adequate for comparing the predictive performance and forecasting capabilities of novel recurrent graph neural network architectures.

The dataset can be accessed [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Hungarian+Chickenpox+Cases).

A preprint our corresponding paper is available [on ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08100) and has been accepted to the Workshop on Graph Learning Benchmarks (GLB 2021) at The Web Conference 2021

Managers in Politics
