I am an Economics PhD Candidate at the Department of Economics and Business at Central European University. I'm supervised by [Adam Szeidl](http://www.personal.ceu.hu/staff/Adam_Szeidl/). I especially enjoy constructing efficient data pipelines to understand patterns in otherwise difficult-to-handle, large data sets. 

I received my MA in Economics at CEU and my BA in Applied Economics at Corvinus University of Budapest. I also have a pre-degree certificate from the Business and Management BA program of Corvinus University of Budapest.

I am also a research assistant at the [CEU Microdata Research Group](http://microdata.io) since 2015 where I mostly work on data engineering tasks.

Pytorch Geometric Temporal
-----
PyTorch Geometric Temporal is a deep learning framework combining state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for neural spatiotemporal signal processing. The main goal of the library is to make temporal geometric deep learning available for researchers and machine learning practitioners in a unified easy-to-use framework. PyTorch Geometric Temporal was created with foundations on existing libraries in the PyTorch eco-system, streamlined neural network layer definitions, temporal snapshot generators for batching, and integrated benchmark datasets. These features are illustrated with a tutorial-like case study. Experiments demonstrate the predictive performance of the models implemented in the library on real world problems such as epidemiological forecasting, ride-hail demand prediction and web-traffic management. Our sensitivity analysis of runtime shows that the framework can potentially operate on web-scale datasets with rich temporal features and spatial structure.

The GitHub repository of the project is available [here](https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki/pytorch_geometric_temporal).

A preprint of our corresponding paper is available [on ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07788). The paper is under review at CIKM 2021.

Chickenpox cases - Hungary
-----
Recurrent graph convolutional neural networks are highly effective machine learning techniques for spatiotemporal signal processing. Newly proposed graph neural network architectures are repetitively evaluated on standard tasks such as traffic or weather forecasting. In this paper, we propose the Chickenpox Cases in Hungary dataset as a new dataset for comparing graph neural network architectures. Our time series analysis and forecasting experiments demonstrate that the Chickenpox Cases in Hungary dataset is adequate for comparing the predictive performance and forecasting capabilities of novel recurrent graph neural network architectures.

The dataset can be accessed [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Hungarian+Chickenpox+Cases).

A preprint our corresponding paper is available [on ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08100) and has been accepted to the Workshop on Graph Learning Benchmarks (GLB 2021) at The Web Conference 2021
